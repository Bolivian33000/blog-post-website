This is my blog post project! In this project, you are allowed to input the title to your post,
the content assicated with your post, as well as submitting the post to be saved on the website. 
Once you have submitted a post, you can see the Title and content of your first post in the box below the
text that says "What's new?" Once you edit your title and/or content, you can click the "Edit" button to
edit your post. Otherwise, you can delete the post entirely by pressing "Delete." You are able to add as many
posts as you would like while also editing as many posts as you would like.

Thank you for using my app! 


Skills and technologies used: Node.js, Express.js, EJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, use of partials
